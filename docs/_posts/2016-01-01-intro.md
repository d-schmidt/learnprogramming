# Why?
> Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.  
> - Linus Torvalds

I've learned programming at the age of ten, when my dad gave me a [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) book. That was twenty years ago. I still enjoy it and I would like to share some of that fun. If you are willing to try it, I will show you how to get in.

# Using these Tutorials
Knowing how to use Google is important. You will find my searches linked throughout the tutorials.  
There are also (Wikipedia) links everywhere. Feel free to follow them, whenever you want to know more.  
If you get stuck somewhere look at the examples or ask someone! Like [/r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/)
