## Programming
Programming is teaching computers to do stuff.
Computers can do only very very few things. Because they are so dump, you need to to break problems down into parts so small the computer is able to understand them.

On the lowest level computers only know how to copy data around in memory, do basic math on the data, check simple true false conditions and to jump to another point in the [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code). That is it.
For most problem we want computers to solve, writing [code this basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) yourself would be slow and error prune. We use higher languages which hide these few instructions behind more compley, better readable and much more powerful constructs.
