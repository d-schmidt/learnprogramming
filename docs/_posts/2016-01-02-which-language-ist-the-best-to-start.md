Which language should I learn first?  
Where should I start?  
How do I get started with programming?  
If you are asking these questions, I have **an** answer.

There are dozens of high level languages in use today. Each language has some strong and weak points, each is commonly used to solve specific problems.  
If you don't even know the basics of programming, it doesn't matter if you want to build apps, a website or just some tool to automate the boring stuff. Learning another language is easy, once you know the basics and know what to look for in the new language.

## Python 3
Yep that is it. We are going with Python 3 here. It is a powerful language, includes all the basics, allows clean code and it is one of the languages I know.

### Download and Install
* Windows/Mac: [Download Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Linux: `sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip`

### Test It
After installing it, open a command line/console and type in: `python` (linux: `python3`)  
It should look like this:

```
i:\git\learnprogramming>python
Python 3.4.0 (v3.4.0:04f714765c13, Mar 16 2014, 19:25:23) [MSC v.1600 64 bit (AMD64)]
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

Now type `exit()` to leave Python.

### An Text Editor

I suggest using [any](https://www.sublimetext.com/) [editor](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) [supporting](https://atom.io/) [syntax](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit) [highlighting](http://ninja-ide.org/). Python ships with [idle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html) included, just start the `idle.pyw`.  
I prefer sublime, it allows to execute Python code `Tools > Build` directly.

You don't really need these, you could simply use the OS internal editors like Notepad.

Lets start!
