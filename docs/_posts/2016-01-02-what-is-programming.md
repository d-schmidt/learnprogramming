# What is Programming?
Programming is teaching computers to do stuff.  
Computers can do only very very few things. Because they are so dump, you need to to break down problems into parts so small the computer is able to understand them.

On the lowest level computers only know how to copy data around in memory, do basic math on the data, check simple true false conditions, and to jump to another point in the [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code). [That is about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit#Operation).  
For most problems we want computers to solve for us, writing [code this basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) yourself would be slow and error prune. We use higher languages which hide these few instructions behind more complex, better readable and much more powerful constructs.

## Breaking down Problems
There are a lot of reason people want to start programming. Some are in for fast money (Good luck!) but I think most of you have an idea they want to build.  
Whatever your reasons are, wether you have to or want to tell a computer to solve a problem, you to split it into small problems.

### LEGO™
Imagine you want to design this from scratch:  
{% include image.html url="/assets/images/LEGO_42055.jpg" description="Model 42055, ©The LEGO Group" %}

Which bigger parts is it made of? Where do you start? Do you need new blocks?

If you are completely overwhelmed, you are not alone. A team of experienced designers build this monster over month.

How about this?

An Pixar designer spent many month on it and got help from a few experienced LEGO™ designers in the end.

We might get to this:  
{% include image.html url="/assets/images/LEGO_31046.jpg" description="Model 31046, ©The LEGO Group" %}

We start building this:  
{% include image.html url="/assets/images/LEGO_10696.jpg" description="Model 10696, ©The LEGO Group" %}

This one seems simple enough. Only basic blocks are used. You should be able to break it into parts in your mind.  
It might seem boring and simple, but if you are starting fresh, start small. You might skip forward in the tutorials if you already know some or all of the basic building blocks of programs.

### Training Algorithmic Thinking
Being able abstract the project managers whish to be able login into the forum using Facebook into an algorithm and lines of code is something you can train. This does not require a programming language or reading any more chapters.

There is a simple [exercise](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_can_i_improve_my_skill_to_convert_tasks.2Fproblems_into_programs_.28algorithmic_thinking.29.3F "/r/learnprogramming") to help you build this skill:  

* Pick an activity that you do every day, like making breakfast or something similar. It should be not too easy, but also not too difficult.
* Write down the steps that you should do for the activity, but do it out of memory in a different time to when you actually perform the activity. (Write the steps to make breakfast down in the afternoon.)
* The next time you perform the activity take your notes and try to follow the steps religiously. Try not to deviate from your written down steps and if you have to, note the differences down.
* Improve your algorithm until you are satisfied.
* Try this with different activities. The tasks become easier and easier.

I suggest splitting it into 3 parts. Split each of these parts again into 3.  
Getting dressed:  

* get clothes
  * open wardrobe
    * open door
    * open sock drawer
    * if sockdrawer is empty: open laundry bag
  * pickup clothes
  * close wardrobe
* put clothes on
* put shoes on

... and so on. You can play this game for hours until muscles and molecules are moving. We don't need this depth tho. We are not learning assembler here.

Everything else comes from writing **A LOT** of programs. To be honest, this will take more than a few days or weeks.
